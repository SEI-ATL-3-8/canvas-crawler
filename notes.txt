- create the canvas
- set the height and width
- get the context
- draw a recrangle
- comment out the height&width set and see what happens
- make an object w/ render method
- attach listeners to arrows that adjust the x & y of this object
- note that obj props update, but the screen does not
- we need to call render again, but very often
- setInterval a loop function
- add clearRect
- move hero around
- make some ogres
- use a class
- put them in an array, loop through that array to render all
- check collision, just hitting from left
- then just right
- then see that one is always firing
- so we want to conjoin with &&
- now check along y axis too
- take action on collision: mark the ogre as dead
- only render ogres if alive
- if all ogres are dead, you win

helpful hints:
post hero x&y in the DOM inside the gameLoop
if you want something to move without user input, make a separate class, and its render method updates its position before drawRect
