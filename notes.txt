x create the canvas
x set the height and width
x get the context
x draw a recrangle
x comment out the height&width set and see what happens
x make an object w/ render method
x attach listeners to arrows that adjust the x & y of this object
x note that obj props update, but the screen does not
x we need to call render again, but very often
x setInterval a loop function
x add clearRect
x move hero around
x make some ogres
x use a class
x put them in an array, loop through that array to render all
x check collision, just hitting from left
x then just right
x then see that one is always firing
x so we want to conjoin with &&
x now check along y axis too
x take action on collision: mark the ogre as dead
x only render ogres if alive
x if all ogres are dead, you win

helpful hints:
post hero x&y in the DOM inside the gameLoop
if you want something to move without user input, make a separate class, and its render method updates its position before drawRect
