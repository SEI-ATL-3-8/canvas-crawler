# Canvas crawler!
We're going to use a tool called canvas to build a simple little game of tag-the-ogres together. In `notes.txt`, the steps to do this are outlined, but not in enough detail to complete them independently. That's so that you can take notes on these steps as we go. Canvas is not a tool you can learn to use by rote memorization; you'll need to understand how the pieces fit together, and which pieces can change and which need to stay the same.
